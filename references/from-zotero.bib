	abstract = {Friedrich Engels’ dialectical assessment of modern science resulted from his fascination with the natural sciences (cell physiology, thermodynamics, theory of evolution) in combination with his resurging interest in the work of “old Hegel.” Engels became especially interested in what he saw as the molecular essence of life, namely proteins or, more specifically, albumin (Eiweiß), seeing life as the mode of existence of these enigmatic substances. Hegelian dialectics is crucial for a dialectical materialist understanding of contemporary technoscience. The dialectical materialist understanding of technoscience as a research practice builds on Engels, but also on later (scientific) authors who were inspired by his writings, e.g., life scientists such as Haldane and Bernal. Considering the criticism raised against Engels’ dialectics by 20th-century Marxists, a dialectical diagnostic of contemporary technoscience can be achieved, which shifts the focus from artificial albumin as “living matter” (as discussed by Engels) to contemporary research on synthetic cells (as anticipated by Engels).},

We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identiﬁed multiple speciﬁc regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identiﬁed a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identiﬁcation of the same regions using two approaches reﬂects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.},

Although the previous coronavirus SARS-C oV and MERS-C oV epidemics raised awareness of the need for clinically available therapeutic or preventive interventions, to date, no treatments with proven efficacy are available. The development of effective intervention strategies relies on the knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections, which highlights the significance of studying virus–host interactions at the molecular level to identify targets for antiviral intervention and to elucidate critical viral and host determinants that are decisive for the development of severe disease. In this Review, we summarize the first discoveries that shape our current understanding of SARS-C oV-2 infection throughout the intracellular viral life cycle and relate that to our knowledge of coronavirus biology. The elucidation of similarities and differences between SARS-C oV-2 and other coronaviruses will support future preparedness and strategies to combat coronavirus infections.},

However, therapeutic options for treatment are still very limited. The development of drugs that target vital proteins in the viral life cycle is a feasible approach for treating COVID-19. Belonging to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae with the largest RNA genome, SARS-C oV-2 encodes a total of 29 proteins. These non-s tructural, structural and accessory proteins participate in entry into host cells, genome replication and transcription, and viral assembly and release. SARS-C oV-2 proteins can individually perform essential physiological roles, be components of the viral replication machinery or interact with numerous host cellular factors. In this Review, we delineate the structural features of SARS-C oV-2 from the whole viral particle to the individual viral proteins and discuss their functions as well as their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins is essential for adaptive immunity. Prior to presentation, peptides need to be generated from proteins that are either produced by the cell’s own translational machinery or that are funneled into the endo-lysosomal vesicular system. The prolonged interaction between a T cell receptor and specific pMHC complexes, after an extensive search process in secondary lymphatic organs, eventually triggers T cells to proliferate and to mount a specific cellular immune response. Once processed, the peptide repertoire presented by MHC proteins largely depends on structural features of the binding groove of each particular MHC allelic variant. Additionally, two peptide editors—tapasin for class I and HLA-DM for class II—contribute to the shaping of the presented peptidome by favoring the binding of high-affinity antigens. Although there is a vast amount of biochemical and structural information, the mechanism of the catalyzed peptide exchange for MHC class I and class II proteins still remains controversial, and it is not well understood why certain MHC allelic variants are more susceptible to peptide editing than others. Recent studies predict a high impact of protein intermediate states on MHC allele-specific peptide presentation, which implies a profound influence of MHC dynamics on the phenomenon of immunodominance and the development of autoimmune diseases. Here, we review the recent literature that describe MHC class I and II dynamics from a theoretical and experimental point of view and we highlight the similarities between MHC class I and class II dynamics despite the distinct functions they fulfill in adaptive immunity.},

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are expressed on the cell surface, where they present peptides to T cells, which gives them a key role in the development of T-cell immune responses. MHC molecules come in two main variants: MHC Class I (MHC-I) and MHC Class II (MHC-II). MHC-I predominantly present peptides derived from intracellular proteins, whereas MHC-II predominantly presents peptides from extracellular proteins. In both cases, the binding between MHC and antigenic peptides is the most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway. Therefore, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC is a powerful utility to predict the possible speciﬁcity of a T-cell immune response. Commonly MHC binding prediction tools are trained on binding afﬁnity or mass spectrometryeluted ligands. Recent studies have however demonstrated how the integration of both data types can boost predictive performances. Inspired by this, we here present NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0, two web servers created to predict binding between peptides and MHC-I and MHC-II, respectively. Both methods exploit tailored machine learning strategies to integrate different training data types, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and outperforming their competitors.

This region is the most polymorphic region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this information, providing the scientific and medical community access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the number of new variants being identified has necessitated a dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.},

We observed that proline residues are preferentially removed from the proteome of prevalent mutants, leading to a predicted global loss of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in individuals expressing HLA-B alleles of the B7 supertype family; this is largely driven by a dominant C-to-U mutation type at the RNA level. These results indicate that B7-supertype-associated epitopes, including the most immunodominant ones, were more likely to escape CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance during the ﬁrst year of the pandemic.},

The emergence of SARS-C oV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-C oV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of ‘variants of concern’, that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-C oV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-C oV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.},

However, numbers of infected cases, deaths, and mortality rates related to COVID-19 vary from country to country. Although many studies were conducted, the reasons of these differences have not been clariﬁed. In this study, we comprehensively investigated 12,343 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients/individuals in six geographic areas and identiﬁed a total of 1234 mutations by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Through a hierarchical clustering based on the mutant frequencies, we classiﬁed the 28 countries into three clusters showing different fatality rates of COVID-19. In correlation analyses, we identiﬁed that ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are in a strong linkage disequilibrium, showed signiﬁcant positive correlations with fatality rates (r = 0.41, P = 0.029 and r = 0.43, P = 0.022, respectively). We found that BCG-vaccination status signiﬁcantly associated with the fatality rates as well as number of infected cases. In BCG-vaccinated countries, the frequency of the S 614G variant had a trend of association with the higher fatality rate. We also found that the frequency of several HLA alleles, including HLA-A*11:01, were signiﬁcantly associated with the fatality rates, although these factors were associated with number of infected cases and not an independent factor to affect fatality rate in each country. Our ﬁndings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as BCG-vaccination status and a host genetic factor, HLA genotypes might affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19.},

              identified superspreading events in specific settings and analyzed them phylogenetically (see the Perspective by Alizon). Using ancestral trait inference, the authors identified several importation events, further investigated the context and contribution of particular superspreading events to the establishment of local and wider SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and used viral phylogenies to describe sustained transmission.

              INTRODUCTION
              We used genomic epidemiology to investigate the introduction and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Boston area across the first wave of the pandemic, from March through May 2020, including high-density sampling early in this period. Our analysis provides a window into the amplification of transmission in an urban setting, including the impact of superspreading events on local, national, and international spread.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Superspreading is recognized as an important driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the determinants of superspreading—why apparently similar circumstances can lead to very different outcomes—are poorly understood. The broader impact of such events, both on local transmission and on the overall trajectory of the pandemic, can also be difficult to determine. Our dataset includes hundreds of cases that resulted from superspreading events with different epidemiological features, which allowed us to investigate the nature and effect of superspreading events in the first wave of the pandemic in the Boston area and to track their broader impact.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Our data suggest that there were more than 120 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area, but that only a few of these were responsible for most local transmission: 29\% of the introductions accounted for 85\% of the cases. At least some of this variation results from superspreading events amplifying some lineages and not others. Analysis of two superspreading events in our dataset illustrate how some introductions can be amplified by superspreading. One occurred in a skilled nursing facility, where multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in a short time period. Only one of these led to rapid and extensive spread within the facility, and significant mortality in this vulnerable population, but there was little onward transmission. A second superspreading event, at an international business conference, led to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless and other higher-risk communities, and was exported domestically and internationally, ultimately resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases. The two events also differed substantially in the genetic variation they generated, possibly suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results also show how genomic data can be used to support cluster investigations in real time—in this case, ruling out connections between contemporaneous cases at Massachusetts General Hospital, where nosocomial transmission was suspected.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our results provide powerful evidence of the importance of superspreading events in shaping the course of this pandemic and illustrate how some introductions, when amplified under unfortunate circumstances, can have an outsized effect with devastating consequences that extend far beyond the initial events themselves. Our findings further highlight the close relationships between seemingly disconnected groups and populations during a pandemic: Viruses introduced at an international business conference seeded major outbreaks among individuals experiencing homelessness; spread throughout the Boston area, including to other higher-risk communities; and were exported extensively to other domestic and international sites. They also illustrate an important reality: Although superspreading among vulnerable populations has a larger immediate impact on mortality, the cost to society is greater for superspreading events that involve younger, healthier, and more mobile populations because of the increased risk of subsequent transmission. This is relevant to ongoing efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly if vaccines prove to be more effective at preventing disease than blocking transmission.
              
                
                  Schematic outline of this genomic epidemiology study.
                  Illustrated are the numerous introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area; the minimal spread of most introductions; and the local, national, and international impact of the amplification of one introduction by a large superspreading event.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Analysis of 772 complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from early in the Boston-area epidemic revealed numerous introductions of the virus, a small number of which led to most cases. The data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, whereas other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed substantially in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results show how genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link between individual clusters and wider community spread.},

However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identiﬁed 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high afﬁnity ({\textless}0.5\%- and 2\%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-afﬁnity epitopes were signiﬁcantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identiﬁed 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8\% of the Japanese population. The ﬁndings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.},

            T cells play a vital role in combatting SARS-CoV-2 and forming long-term memory responses. Whereas extensive structural information is available on neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, such information on SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bound to their peptide–MHC targets is lacking. Here we determine the structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ). The structures reveal the basis for selection of particular TRAV and TRBV germline genes by the public but not the private TCR, and for the ability of the TCRs to recognize natural variants of RLQ but not YLQ. Neither TCR recognizes homologous epitopes from human seasonal coronaviruses. By elucidating the mechanism for TCR recognition of an immunodominant yet variable epitope (YLQ) and a conserved but less commonly targeted epitope (RLQ), this study can inform prospective efforts to design vaccines to elicit pan-coronavirus immunity.},

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients’ medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines.},

They provide several advantages over more traditional approaches to vaccine development, showing strong immunogenicity and an overall favorable safety proﬁle. While preclinical testing has provided some key insights on how RNA vaccines interact with the innate immune system, their mechanism of action appears to be fragmented amid the literature, making it difﬁcult to formulate new hypotheses to be tested in clinical settings and ultimately improve this technology platform. Here, we propose a systems biology approach, based on the combination of literature mining and mechanistic graphical modeling, to consolidate existing knowledge around mRNA vaccines mode of action and enhance the translatability of preclinical hypotheses into clinical evidence. A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for automated knowledge extraction retrieved key biological evidences that were joined into an interactive mechanistic graphical model representing the chain of immune events induced by mRNA vaccines administration. The achieved mechanistic graphical model will help the design of future experiments, foster the generation of new hypotheses and set the basis for the development of mathematical models capable of simulating and predicting the immune response to mRNA vaccines.},

            An interesting inference drawn by some COVID-19 epidemiological models is that there exists a proportion of the population who are not susceptible to infection—even at the start of the current pandemic. This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay—based on sequential serology—that provides a (1) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (2) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.},

            The selection of peptides presented by MHC molecules is crucial for antigen discovery. Previously, several predictors have shown impressive performance on binding affinity.

Here, we connected HLA alleles with binding motifs via our deep learning-based framework, MHCfovea. MHCfovea expanded the knowledge of MHC-I-binding motifs from 150 to 13,008 alleles. After clustering N-terminal and C-terminal sub-motifs on both observed and unobserved alleles, MHCfovea calculated the hyper-motifs and the corresponding allele signatures on the important positions to disclose the relation between binding motifs and MHC-I sequences. MHCfovea delivered 32 pairs of hyper-motifs and allele signatures (HLA-A: 13, HLA-B: 12, and HLA-C: 7). The paired hyper-motifs and allele signatures disclosed the critical polymorphic residues that determine the binding preference, which are believed to be valuable for antigen discovery and vaccine design when allele specificity is concerned.},

It is based on two phenomena: the constitution of the repertoire of naive T lymphocytes and the evolution of the pathogen and its impact on the immune memory of T lymphocytes. Concerning the latter, pathogen evolution will have a different impact on reinfection depending on the MHC allomorph. If a mutation occurs in a given region, in the case of MHC allotypes, which do not recognize the peptide in this region, the mutation will have no impact on the memory repertoire. In the case where the MHC allomorph binds to the ancestral peptides and not to the mutated peptide, that individual will have a higher chance of being reinfected. This difference in ﬁtness will lead to a variation of the allele frequency in the next generation. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic already support a signiﬁcant part of this hypothesis and following up on these data may enable it to be conﬁrmed. This hypothesis could explain why some individuals after vaccination respond less well than others to variants and leads to predict the probability of reinfection after a ﬁrst infection depending upon the variant and the HLA allomorph.},

	abstract = {Rapidly appearing SARS-CoV-2 mutations can affect T cell epitopes, which can help the virus to evade either CD8 or CD4 T-cell responses. We developed T-cell COVID-19 Atlas (T-CoV, https://t-cov.hse.ru) –the comprehensive web portal, which allows one to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 mutations alter the presentation of viral peptides by HLA molecules. The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding afﬁnities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants. In summary, we believe that TCoV will help researchers and clinicians to predict the susceptibility of individuals with different HLA genotypes to infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2 and/or forecast its severity.},

We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptideMHC class I binding afﬁnity across 145 HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARSCoV-2 peptides. We further explored the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was successfully sampled and was represented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (M. Lin, H.-T. Tseng, J. A. Trejaut, H.-L. Lee, et al., BMC Med Genet 4:9, 2003, https://bmcmedgenet .biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9). Conversely, we found that HLAB*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we reported global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramiﬁcations in the setting of the current pandemic.},

Relation RR and OR - case controls aceita só OR
“the OR is amenable to analysis by multivariate statistical techniques that allow extension to incorporate further SNPs, risk factors and clinical variables. Such techniques include logistic regression and other types of log-linear models” (Clarke et al., 2011, p. 122)
“To work with observations made at the allelic (gamete) rather than the genotypic (individual) level, it is necessary to assume (i) that there is Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the population, (ii) that the disease has a low prevalence ( {\textless} 10\%) and (iii) that the disease risks are multiplicative.” (Clarke et al., 2011, p. 123)
“The OR comparing the odds of allele A between cases and controls is called the allelic RR (γ*). It can be shown that the genetic penetrance parameter in a multiplicative model of penetrance is closely approximated by the allelic RR, i.e., γ ≈ γ* (ref. 10)” (Clarke et al., 2011, p. 123)
“More complicated logistic regression models of association are used when there is a need to include additional covariates to handle complex traits. Examples of this are situations in which we expect disease risk to be modified by environmental effects such as epidemiological risk factors (e.g., smoking and gender), clinical variables (e.g., disease severity and age at onset) and population stratification (e.g., principal components capturing variation due to differential ancestry3), or by the interactive and joint effects of other marker loci.” (Clarke et al., 2011, p. 123)

“. To adjust for any residual population structure during association testing, the principal components from principal component analyses or multidimensional scaling methods can be included as covariates in a logistic regression.” (Clarke et al., 2011, p. 126)

We have since analyzed a larger public patient cohort data (n = 126 patients) with controls, associated demographic and clinical data. By combining the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, along with their associated risk significance. Results. We observe HLA-II DPA1*02:02 at a higher frequency in the COVID-19 positive cohort (29\%) when compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fisher’s exact test [FET] p = 0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not appear to put this cohort’s patients at an increased risk of hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity outcomes, including admission to intensive care, reveal nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p = 0.0078) and C*04:01 (FET p = 0.0087).},

RESULTS We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P{\textless}5×10−8) in the meta-analysis of the two case–control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P = 1.15×10−10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P = 4.95×10−8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group–specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48×10−4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06×10−5).
CONCLUSIONS We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system. (Funded by Stein Erik Hagen and others.)},

	abstract = {The world is dealing with one of the worst pandemics ever. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that has already spread to more than 200 countries. However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of
              in silico
              predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified three potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the four-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use a populational approach in association with COVID-19 outcome.},

	abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 is showing huge, unexplained, diﬀerences between northern and southern Italy. We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of speciﬁc class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these diﬀerences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate ﬁxed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson’s coeﬃcients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value {\textless} 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson’s coeﬃcients between −0.47 and −0.59, p-value {\textless} 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16\% (95\%CI: 0.1–35\%) per 1\% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19\% (95\%CI: 1–41\%) per 1\% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identiﬁcation of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to deﬁne more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.},

Several aspects of its pathogenesis and related clinical consequences have not yet been elucidated. Infection rates, as well morbidity and mortality differed within countries. It is intriguing for scientists to understand how patient genetics may influence the outcome of the condition, to clarify which aspects could be related the clinical variability of SARS-CoV-2 disease. We reviewed the studies exploring the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genotypes on individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or progression, discussing also the contribution of the immunological patterns MHC-related. In March 2021, the main online databases were accessed. All the articles that investigated the possible association between the HLA genotypes and related polymorphisms with susceptibility, severity and progression of COVID-19 were considered. Although both genetic and environmental factors are certainly expected to influence the susceptibility to or protection of individuals, the HLA and related polymorphisms can influence susceptibility, progression and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The crucial role played by HLA molecules in the immune response, especially through pathogen-derived peptide presentation, and the huge molecular variability of HLA alleles in the human populations could be responsible for the different rates of infection and the different patients following COVID-19 infection.},

	abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a speciﬁc immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides at the cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identiﬁed with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was signiﬁcantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a speciﬁc immune response to COVID-19.},

NGS has led to a dramatically increased sequencing throughput at high accuracy, while being more time and cost efficient than precursor technologies. This has led to a broader and deeper profiling of the key genes in the human immunogenetic make-up. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies is evidenced by the development of varied short-read sequencing platforms with differing read lengths and sequencing capacities to long-read sequencing platforms capable of profiling full genes without fragmentation. Concomitantly, there has been development of a diverse set of computational analyses and software tools developed to deal with the various strengths and limitations of the sequencing data generated by the different sequencing platforms. This review surveys the different modalities involved in generating NGS HLA profiling sequence data. It systematically describes various computational approaches that have been developed to achieve HLA genotyping to different degrees of resolution. At each stage, this review enumerates the drawbacks and advantages of each of the platforms and analysis approaches, thus providing a comprehensive picture of the current state of HLA genotyping technologies.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Despite being essential for numerous clinical and research applications, high-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing remains challenging and laboratory tests are also time-consuming and labour intensive. With next-generation sequencing data becoming widely accessible, on-demand in silico HLA typing offers an economical and efﬁcient alternative. Results: In this study we evaluate the HLA typing accuracy and efﬁciency of ﬁve computational HLA typing methods by comparing their predictions against a curated set of {\textgreater} 1000 published polymerase chain reaction-derived HLA genotypes on three different data sets (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and transcriptomic sequencing data). The highest accuracy at clinically relevant resolution (four digits) we observe is 81\% on RNAseq data by PHLAT and 99\% accuracy by OPTITYPE when limited to Class I genes only. We also observed variability between the tools for resource consumption, with runtime ranging from an average of 5 h (HLAMINER) to 7 min (SEQ2HLA) and memory from 12.8 GB (HLA-VBSEQ) to 0.46 GB (HLAMINER) per sample. While a minimal coverage is required, other factors also determine prediction accuracy and the results between tools do not correlate well. Therefore, by combining tools, there is the potential to develop a highly accurate ensemble method that is able to deliver fast, economical HLA typing from existing sequencing data.},

Methods.  DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 loci were typed using sequence-specific oligonucleotides. In silico studies were performed using X-ray resolved dimer constructions.
Results.  The DQA1*01, DQA1*05, DQB1*02, or DQB1*06 genotypes/haplotypes and DQA1/DQB1 haplotypes that encode the putative DQA1/DQB1 dimers were overrepresented in the whole group of patients and in patients exhibiting peripheral neurological spectrum disorders (PSD) or encephalitis spectrum disorders (ESD). The DRB1*04, DRB1*13, and DQA1*03 allele groups protected against arbovirus neurological manifestation, being underrepresented in whole group of patients and ESD and PSD groups. Genetic and in silico studies revealed that DQA1/DQB1 dimers (1) were primarily associated with susceptibility to arbovirus infections; (2) can bind to a broad range of ZIKV peptides (235 of 1878 peptides, primarily prM and NS2A); and (3) exhibited hydrophilic and highly positively charged grooves when compared to the DRA1/DRB1 cleft. The protective dimer (DRA1/DRB1*04) bound a limited number of ZIKV peptides (40 of 1878 peptides, primarily prM).
Conclusion.  Protective haplotypes may recognize arbovirus peptides more specifically than susceptible haplotypes.},

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients’ medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines.},

The released predictor, MHCﬂurry 1.2.0, uses mass spectrometry datasets for model selection and showed competitive accuracy with standard tools, including the recently released NetMHCpan 4.0, on a small benchmark of afﬁnity measurements. MHCﬂurry’s prediction speed exceeded 7,000 predictions per second, 396 times faster than NetMHCpan 4.0.

	abstract = {To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identiﬁed 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high afﬁnity ({\textless}0.5\%- and 2\%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-afﬁnity epitopes were signiﬁcantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identiﬁed 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8\% of the Japanese population. The ﬁndings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.},

            T cells play a vital role in combatting SARS-CoV-2 and forming long-term memory responses. Whereas extensive structural information is available on neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, such information on SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bound to their peptide–MHC targets is lacking. Here we determine the structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ). The structures reveal the basis for selection of particular TRAV and TRBV germline genes by the public but not the private TCR, and for the ability of the TCRs to recognize natural variants of RLQ but not YLQ. Neither TCR recognizes homologous epitopes from human seasonal coronaviruses. By elucidating the mechanism for TCR recognition of an immunodominant yet variable epitope (YLQ) and a conserved but less commonly targeted epitope (RLQ), this study can inform prospective efforts to design vaccines to elicit pan-coronavirus immunity.},

However, in many parts of Africa fewer than expected cases of COVID-19, with lower rates of mortality, have been reported. Individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles can affect both the susceptibility and the severity of viral infections. In the case of COVID-19 such an analysis may contribute to identifying individuals at higher risk of the disease and the epidemiological level to understanding the differences between countries in the epidemic patterns. It is also recognized that first antigen exposure influences the consequence of subsequent exposure. We thus propose a theory incorporating HLA antigens, the “original antigenic sin (OAS)” effect, and presentation of viral peptides which could explain with differential susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infections.},
