            T cells play a vital role in combatting SARS-CoV-2 and forming long-term memory responses. Whereas extensive structural information is available on neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, such information on SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bound to their peptide–MHC targets is lacking. Here we determine the structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ). The structures reveal the basis for selection of particular TRAV and TRBV germline genes by the public but not the private TCR, and for the ability of the TCRs to recognize natural variants of RLQ but not YLQ. Neither TCR recognizes homologous epitopes from human seasonal coronaviruses. By elucidating the mechanism for TCR recognition of an immunodominant yet variable epitope (YLQ) and a conserved but less commonly targeted epitope (RLQ), this study can inform prospective efforts to design vaccines to elicit pan-coronavirus immunity.},

	abstract = {To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identiﬁed 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high afﬁnity ({\textless}0.5\%- and 2\%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-afﬁnity epitopes were signiﬁcantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identiﬁed 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8\% of the Japanese population. The ﬁndings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.},

We introduce an open-source package for MHC I binding prediction, MHCﬂurry. The software implements allele-speciﬁc neural networks that use a novel architecture and peptide encoding scheme. When trained on afﬁnity measurements, MHCﬂurry outperformed the standard predictors NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 3.0 overall and particularly on non-9-mer peptides in a benchmark of ligands identiﬁed by mass spectrometry. The released predictor, MHCﬂurry 1.2.0, uses mass spectrometry datasets for model selection and showed competitive accuracy with standard tools, including the recently released NetMHCpan 4.0, on a small benchmark of afﬁnity measurements. MHCﬂurry’s prediction speed exceeded 7,000 predictions per second, 396 times faster than NetMHCpan 4.0. MHCﬂurry is freely available to use, retrain, or extend, includes Python library and command line interfaces, may be installed using package managers, and applies software development best practices.},

	abstract = {After the announcement of a new coronavirus in China in December 2019, which was then called SARS-CoV-2, this virus changed to a global concern and it was then declared as a pandemic by WHO. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients’ medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines.},

Methods.  DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 loci were typed using sequence-specific oligonucleotides. In silico studies were performed using X-ray resolved dimer constructions.
Results.  The DQA1*01, DQA1*05, DQB1*02, or DQB1*06 genotypes/haplotypes and DQA1/DQB1 haplotypes that encode the putative DQA1/DQB1 dimers were overrepresented in the whole group of patients and in patients exhibiting peripheral neurological spectrum disorders (PSD) or encephalitis spectrum disorders (ESD). The DRB1*04, DRB1*13, and DQA1*03 allele groups protected against arbovirus neurological manifestation, being underrepresented in whole group of patients and ESD and PSD groups. Genetic and in silico studies revealed that DQA1/DQB1 dimers (1) were primarily associated with susceptibility to arbovirus infections; (2) can bind to a broad range of ZIKV peptides (235 of 1878 peptides, primarily prM and NS2A); and (3) exhibited hydrophilic and highly positively charged grooves when compared to the DRA1/DRB1 cleft. The protective dimer (DRA1/DRB1*04) bound a limited number of ZIKV peptides (40 of 1878 peptides, primarily prM).
Conclusion.  Protective haplotypes may recognize arbovirus peptides more specifically than susceptible haplotypes.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Despite being essential for numerous clinical and research applications, high-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing remains challenging and laboratory tests are also time-consuming and labour intensive. With next-generation sequencing data becoming widely accessible, on-demand in silico HLA typing offers an economical and efﬁcient alternative. Results: In this study we evaluate the HLA typing accuracy and efﬁciency of ﬁve computational HLA typing methods by comparing their predictions against a curated set of {\textgreater} 1000 published polymerase chain reaction-derived HLA genotypes on three different data sets (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and transcriptomic sequencing data). The highest accuracy at clinically relevant resolution (four digits) we observe is 81\% on RNAseq data by PHLAT and 99\% accuracy by OPTITYPE when limited to Class I genes only. We also observed variability between the tools for resource consumption, with runtime ranging from an average of 5 h (HLAMINER) to 7 min (SEQ2HLA) and memory from 12.8 GB (HLA-VBSEQ) to 0.46 GB (HLAMINER) per sample. While a minimal coverage is required, other factors also determine prediction accuracy and the results between tools do not correlate well. Therefore, by combining tools, there is the potential to develop a highly accurate ensemble method that is able to deliver fast, economical HLA typing from existing sequencing data.},

NGS has led to a dramatically increased sequencing throughput at high accuracy, while being more time and cost efficient than precursor technologies. This has led to a broader and deeper profiling of the key genes in the human immunogenetic make-up. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies is evidenced by the development of varied short-read sequencing platforms with differing read lengths and sequencing capacities to long-read sequencing platforms capable of profiling full genes without fragmentation. Concomitantly, there has been development of a diverse set of computational analyses and software tools developed to deal with the various strengths and limitations of the sequencing data generated by the different sequencing platforms. This review surveys the different modalities involved in generating NGS HLA profiling sequence data. It systematically describes various computational approaches that have been developed to achieve HLA genotyping to different degrees of resolution. At each stage, this review enumerates the drawbacks and advantages of each of the platforms and analysis approaches, thus providing a comprehensive picture of the current state of HLA genotyping technologies.},

	abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a speciﬁc immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides at the cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identiﬁed with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was signiﬁcantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a speciﬁc immune response to COVID-19.},

Individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles can affect both the susceptibility and the severity of viral infections. In the case of COVID-19 such an analysis may contribute to identifying individuals at higher risk of the disease and the epidemiological level to understanding the differences between countries in the epidemic patterns.

Recent studies have also shown that variants in 15 genes related to type I interferon immunity to inﬂuenza virus might predispose patients toward life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Other genes (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, XCR1, IL6, CTSL, ABO, and FURIN) and HLA alleles have also been implicated in the response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.},

However, in many parts of Africa fewer than expected cases of COVID-19, with lower rates of mortality, have been reported. Individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles can affect both the susceptibility and the severity of viral infections. In the case of COVID-19 such an analysis may contribute to identifying individuals at higher risk of the disease and the epidemiological level to understanding the differences between countries in the epidemic patterns. It is also recognized that first antigen exposure influences the consequence of subsequent exposure. We thus propose a theory incorporating HLA antigens, the “original antigenic sin (OAS)” effect, and presentation of viral peptides which could explain with differential susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

Several aspects of its pathogenesis and related clinical consequences have not yet been elucidated. Infection rates, as well morbidity and mortality differed within countries. It is intriguing for scientists to understand how patient genetics may influence the outcome of the condition, to clarify which aspects could be related the clinical variability of SARS-CoV-2 disease. We reviewed the studies exploring the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genotypes on individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or progression, discussing also the contribution of the immunological patterns MHC-related. In March 2021, the main online databases were accessed. All the articles that investigated the possible association between the HLA genotypes and related polymorphisms with susceptibility, severity and progression of COVID-19 were considered. Although both genetic and environmental factors are certainly expected to influence the susceptibility to or protection of individuals, the HLA and related polymorphisms can influence susceptibility, progression and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The crucial role played by HLA molecules in the immune response, especially through pathogen-derived peptide presentation, and the huge molecular variability of HLA alleles in the human populations could be responsible for the different rates of infection and the different patients following COVID-19 infection.},

	abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 is showing huge, unexplained, diﬀerences between northern and southern Italy. We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of speciﬁc class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these diﬀerences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate ﬁxed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson’s coeﬃcients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value {\textless} 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson’s coeﬃcients between −0.47 and −0.59, p-value {\textless} 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16\% (95\%CI: 0.1–35\%) per 1\% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19\% (95\%CI: 1–41\%) per 1\% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identiﬁcation of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to deﬁne more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.},

However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of
              in silico
              predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified three potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the four-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use a populational approach in association with COVID-19 outcome.},

RESULTS We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P{\textless}5×10−8) in the meta-analysis of the two case–control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P = 1.15×10−10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P = 4.95×10−8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group–specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48×10−4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06×10−5).
CONCLUSIONS We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system. (Funded by Stein Erik Hagen and others.)},
